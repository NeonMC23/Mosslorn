      <h2><em>Fall of Mosslorn</em></h2>
      <p>
        _ ”<em>
          They used to call it
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Mosslorn</strong
          >. A towering city of glass and steel. Hyper-modern. Hyper-efficient.
          A symbol of what humanity could become.<br /><br />

          Then —
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >everything stopped</strong
          >.<br />
          No sirens. No bombs. No last broadcasts. The world simply… went
          silent.<br /><br />

          Nature didn’t hesitate.
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Ivy crawled</strong
          >
          up the monuments.
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Moss swallowed the roads</strong
          >. Trees pierced the ceilings of offices long emptied. Mosslorn stood
          still, but it was no longer dead.<br /><br />

          Now, only whispers remain. Half-broken radios, old security footage,
          shattered journals.<br /><br />

          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >You awaken in this city</strong
          >
          with others — or perhaps alone. You know nothing except this:
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >you must survive</strong
          >.<br /><br />

          The day is heavy:
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >heat, moisture, exhaustion</strong
          >.<br />
          The night is worse:
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >they come</strong
          >. Creatures of hunger and instinct, prowling the depths of what used
          to be home.<br /><br />

          But you're not the only survivor. Somewhere in the ruins, others are
          moving too.
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Allies? Enemies?</strong
          ><br /><br />

          Maybe you'll find them. Maybe you'll form something new. Or
          maybe...<br />
          You’ll be like the others,
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >lost in the shadows of Mosslorn</strong
          >.<br /><br />

          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Mosslorn will bury you</strong
          >
          like all the others. </em

      <h2><em>The Days and Nights of Mosslorn</em></h2>
      <p>
        _ ”<em>
          The sun never feels quite right in Mosslorn. It’s
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >too hot</strong
          >. The air clings to your skin. Even walking feels like moving through
          water.<br /><br />

          The ruins are vast — towering buildings stretch from the old street
          level to the skies, their insides
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >choked with roots and silence</strong
          >. Each alley, each tunnel, each rooftop tells a story. But
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >stories won’t keep you alive</strong
          >.<br /><br />

          You’re part of a
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >small team</strong
          >
          — two, maybe three — scattered somewhere within this
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >1000-block wasteland</strong
          >. You have no guide. No objective. Just instincts and whatever scraps
          you can find.<br /><br />

          During the day,
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >survival is a slow bleed</strong
          >. Heat drains your strength. Equipment fails. Your speed falters. The
          deeper you go into the city, the worse it gets.<br /><br />

          When night falls,
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >the rules change</strong
          >.
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >The city awakens</strong
          >.<br />
          Shadows twist into teeth. Buildings breathe. Creatures hunt. Some say
          they were always here — waiting for us to leave. Others think they're
          what's left of us.<br /><br />

          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >You can hear them at night</strong
          >. The growls, the whispers, the rustling of leaves. <br /><br />

          And somewhere, deep in the concrete bones of this place, there are
          others.
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >Survivors like you</strong
          >. Maybe you’ll meet. Maybe you'll fight. Maybe you’ll build something
          better.<br /><br />

          Or maybe
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >this city will eat you too</strong
          >.<br /><br />

          You get
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >one life</strong
          >.<br /><br />

          One chance to
          <strong style="letter-spacing: 0.05rem; color: #22c0bb"
            >make Mosslorn remember your name</strong
